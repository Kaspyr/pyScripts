## Scripts
- **stringReplace.py**
	- This is a basic search and replace program written in python. To use it you will give the script a File that the you wish to search through. Then you give it the string you want to replace and the string you wish to use to replace it with. It will then save the search to a new file with the changes.

	** ./stringReplace.py \<File Name\> \<oldWord\> \<newWord\> **
